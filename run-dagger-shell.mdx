import { ShellTabs } from '/snippets/shell-tabs.jsx';

The Dagger CLI includes an interactive shell that translates the familiar Bash syntax to Dagger API requests.
It's the simplest and fastest way to run Dagger workflows directly from the command-line.

You can use it for builds, tests, ephemeral environments, deployments, or any other task you want to automate from the terminal.

To start a Dagger Shell session, type `dagger` in your terminal. This will launch an interactive shell where you can execute Dagger commands using a familiar Bash-like syntax.

## Sandboxing

Dagger Shell commands run as sandboxed functions, accessing host resources (files, secrets, services) only when explicitly provided as arguments.
This can make commands slightly more verbose, but also more repeatable, giving you confidence to iterate quickly without second-guessing.

Here's an example of Dagger Shell in action:

```shell Dagger Shell icon="terminal" wrap
container | from alpine | with-exec apk add curl | with-exec -- curl -L https://dagger.io | stdout
```

Here's another, more complex example:

```shell Dagger Shell icon="terminal" wrap
container |
  from cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base |
  with-exec apk add go |
  with-directory /src https://github.com/golang/example#master |
  with-workdir /src/hello |
  with-exec -- go build -o hello . |
  file ./hello |
  export ./hello-from-dagger
```

## Bash frontend, Dagger backend

Dagger Shell uses the Bash syntax as a frontend, but its behavior is quite different in the backend:

- Instead of executing UNIX commands, you _execute Dagger Functions_
- Instead of passing text streams from command to command, you _pass typed objects from function to function_
- Instead of available commands being the same everywhere in the pipeline, _each command is executed in the context of the previous command's output object_. For example, `foo | bar` really means `foo().bar()`
- Instead of using the local host as an execution environment, you _use containerized runtimes_
- Instead of being mixed with regular commands, _shell builtins are prefixed with `.` (similar to SQLite)_

Besides these differences, **all the features** of the Bash *syntax* are available in Dagger Shell, including:

- Shell variables: `container=$(container | from alpine)`
- Shell functions: `container() { container | from alpine; }`
- Job control: `frontend | test & backend | test & .wait`
- Quoting: single quotes and double quotes have the same meaning as in bash

## Input modes

Dagger Shell supports multiple ways to input commands:

<ShellTabs
  systemShellCommand="dagger -c 'container | from alpine | terminal'"
  daggerShellCommand={`dagger <<EOF
container | from alpine | terminal
EOF
`}
  scriptCommand={`#!/usr/bin/env dagger

container |
from alpine |
with-exec cat /etc/os-release |
stdout`}
/>

## Loading modules

Dagger Shell can also load Dagger Modules, inspect their types, and run their functions. This works for both local and remote modules.

This page will cover how to use Dagger Shell for interactive workflow execution, including:

As an example, try running this command:

<ShellTabs
  systemShellCommand="dagger -m github.com/dagger/dagger/docs@v0.18.5"
/>

This loads the module `github.com/dagger/dagger/docs` at version `v0.18.5`. Wait for the Dagger Shell interactive prompt, then:

<ShellTabs
  daggerShellCommand=".help"
/>

We see new commands available, loaded from the module. Let's try running one:

<ShellTabs
  daggerShellCommand="server | up"
/>

This builds the docs server defined in the module, and runs it as an ephemeral service [on your machine](http://localhost:8080).

## Composing modules

You can load multiple modules in the same session, each scoped to a single pipeline, then combine those pipelines into a bigger pipeline. For example:

<ShellTabs
  systemShellCommand={`dagger <<.
github.com/dagger/dagger/modules/wolfi |
container --packages=nginx |
with-directory /var/www $(github.com/dagger/dagger/docs | site)
.`}
/>

This loads `github.com/dagger/dagger/docs` into one pipeline, `github.com/dagger/dagger/modules/wolfi` into another, then combines them.

This works by executing the module's constructor function. It works exactly like executing any other function:

- You can inspect it for arguments: `.help MODULE`
- You can pass arguments: `MODULE --foo=bar --baz`
- You can save it to a variable: `foo=$(MODULE)`
- You can use it in a pipeline: `MODULE | foo | bar`
- You can use that pipeline as a sub-pipeline: `foo --bar=$(MODULE | foo | bar)`

## Variables

Dagger Shell lets you save the result of any command to a variable, using the standard bash syntax.
Values of any type can be saved to a variable, including objects.

Here's an example:
<ShellTabs
    systemShellCommand={`dagger <<'.
repo=$(git https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger | head | tree)
env=$(container | from node:23 | with-directory /app $repo | with-workdir /app)
build=$($env | with-exec npm install | with-exec npm run build | directory ./dist)
container | from nginx | with-directory /usr/share/nginx/html $build | terminal --cmd=/bin/bash
.
`}
    daggerShellCommand={`dagger <<EOF
repo=$(git https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger | head | tree)
env=$(container | from node:23 | with-directory /app $repo | with-workdir /app)
build=$($env | with-exec npm install | with-exec npm run build | directory ./dist)
container | from nginx | with-directory /usr/share/nginx/html $build | terminal --cmd=/bin/bash
EOF
`}
    scriptCommand={`#!/usr/bin/env dagger

repo=$(git https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger | head | tree)
env=$(container | from node:23 | with-directory /app $repo | with-workdir /app)
build=$($env | with-exec npm install | with-exec npm run build | directory ./dist)
container | from nginx | with-directory /usr/share/nginx/html $build | terminal --cmd=/bin/bash
`} />
