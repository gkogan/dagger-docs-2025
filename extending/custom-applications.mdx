## Overview

An alternative approach is to develop a custom application using a Dagger SDK. 

This involves:

- Installing the SDK for your selected language in your development environment
- Initializing a Dagger API client in your application code
- Calling and combining Dagger API methods from your application to achieve the required result
- Executing your application using `dagger run`

<Tab value="go" title="Go">

<Note>
The Dagger Go SDK requires [Go 1.22 or later](https://go.dev/doc/install).
</Note>

From an existing Go module, install the Dagger Go SDK using the commands below:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
go get dagger.io/dagger@latest
```

After importing `dagger.io/dagger` in your Go module code, run the following command to update `go.sum`:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
go mod tidy
```

This example demonstrates how to build a Go application for multiple architectures and Go versions using the Go SDK.

Clone an example project and create a new Go module in the project directory:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
git clone https://go.googlesource.com/example
cd example/hello
mkdir multibuild && cd multibuild
go mod init multibuild
```

Create a new file in the `multibuild` directory named `main.go` and add the following code to it:

```go file=./snippets/clients-sdk/go/main.go
```

This Go program imports the Dagger SDK and defines two functions. The `build()` function represents the workflow and creates a Dagger client, which provides an interface to the Dagger API. It also defines the build matrix, consisting of two OSs (`darwin` and `linux`) and two architectures (`amd64` and `arm64`), and builds the Go application for each combination. The Go build process is instructed via the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` build variables, which are reset for each case.

Try the Go program by executing the command below from the project directory:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
dagger run go run multibuild/main.go
```

The `dagger run` command executes the specified command in a Dagger session and displays live progress. The Go program builds the application for each OS/architecture combination and writes the build results to the host. You will see the build process run four times, once for each combination. Note that the builds are happening concurrently, because the builds do not depend on eachother.

Use the `tree` command to see the build artifacts on the host, as shown below:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
tree build
build
├── 1.22
│   ├── darwin
│   │   ├── amd64
│   │   │   └── hello
│   │   └── arm64
│   │       └── hello
│   └── linux
│       ├── amd64
│       │   └── hello
│       └── arm64
│           └── hello
└── 1.23
    ├── darwin
    │   ├── amd64
    │   │   └── hello
    │   └── arm64
    │       └── hello
    └── linux
        ├── amd64
        │   └── hello
        └── arm64
            └── hello
```

<Tab value="python" title="Python">

<Note>
The Dagger Python SDK requires [Python 3.10 or later](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html).
</Note>

Install the Dagger Python SDK in your project:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
uv add dagger-io
```

If you prefer, you can alternatively add the Dagger Python SDK in your Python program. This is useful in case of dependency conflicts, or to keep your Dagger code self-contained.

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
uv add --script myscript.py dagger-io
```

This example demonstrates how to test a Python application against multiple Python versions using the Python SDK.

Clone an example project:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
git clone --branch 0.101.0 https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi
cd fastapi
```

Create a new file named `test.py` in the project directory and add the following code to it.

```python file=./snippets/clients-sdk/python/test.py
```

This Python program imports the Dagger SDK and defines an asynchronous function named `test()`. This `test()` function creates a Dagger client, which provides an interface to the Dagger API. It also defines the test matrix, consisting of Python versions `3.8` to `3.11` and iterates over this matrix, downloading a Python container image for each specified version and testing the source application in that version.

Add the dependency:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
uv add --script test.py dagger-io
```

Run the Python program by executing the command below from the project directory:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
dagger run uv run test.py
```

The `dagger run` command executes the specified command in a Dagger session and displays live progress. The tool tests the application against each version concurrently and displays the following final output:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
Starting tests for Python 3.8
Starting tests for Python 3.9
Starting tests for Python 3.10
Starting tests for Python 3.11
Tests for Python 3.8 succeeded!
Tests for Python 3.9 succeeded!
Tests for Python 3.11 succeeded!
Tests for Python 3.10 succeeded!
All tasks have finished
```

<Tab value="typescript" title="TypeScript">
<Note>
The Dagger TypeScript SDK requires [TypeScript 5.0 or later](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/). This SDK currently only [supports Node.js (stable) and Bun (experimental)](../configuration/modules.mdx). To execute the TypeScript program, you must also have an TypeScript executor like `ts-node` or `tsx`.
</Note>

Install the Dagger TypeScript SDK in your project using `npm` or `yarn`:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
// using npm
npm install @dagger.io/dagger@latest --save-dev

// using yarn
yarn add @dagger.io/dagger --dev
```

This example demonstrates how to test a Node.js application against multiple Node.js versions using the TypeScript SDK.

Create an example React project (or use an existing one) in TypeScript:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my-app
```

In the project directory, create a new file named `build.mts` and add the following code to it:

```typescript file=./snippets/clients-sdk/typescript/build.mts
```

This TypeScript program imports the Dagger SDK and defines an asynchronous function. This function creates a Dagger client, which provides an interface to the Dagger API. It also defines the test/build matrix, consisting of Node.js versions `16`, `18` and `20`, and iterates over this matrix, downloading a Node.js container image for each specified version and testing and building the source application against that version.

Run the program with a Typescript executor like `ts-node`, as shown below:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
dagger run node --loader ts-node/esm ./build.mts
```

The `dagger run` command executes the specified command in a Dagger session and displays live progress. The program tests and builds the application against each version in sequence. At the end of the process, a built application is available for each Node.js version in a `build-node-XX` folder in the project directory, as shown below:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
tree -L 2 -d build-*
build-node-16
└── static
    ├── css
    ├── js
    └── media
build-node-18
└── static
    ├── css
    ├── js
    └── media
build-node-20
└── static
    ├── css
    ├── js

<Tab value="php" title="PHP">

<Note>
The Dagger PHP SDK requires [PHP 8.2 or later](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).
</Note>

Install the Dagger PHP SDK in your project using `composer`:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
composer require dagger/dagger
```

This example demonstrates how to test a PHP application against multiple PHP versions using the PHP SDK.

Clone an example project:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton.git
cd Slim-Skeleton
```

Create a new file named `test.php` in the project directory and add the following code to it.

```php file=./snippets/clients-sdk/php/test.php
```

This PHP program imports the Dagger SDK and defines a function named `test()`. This `test()` function creates a Dagger client, which provides an interface to the Dagger API. It also defines the test matrix, consisting of PHP versions `8.2` to `8.4` and iterates over this matrix, downloading a PHP container image for each specified version and testing the source application in that version.

Run the PHP program by executing the command below from the project directory:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
dagger run php test.php
```

The `dagger run` command executes the specified command in a Dagger session and displays live progress. The program tests the application against each version concurrently and displays the following final output:

```shell Shell icon="terminal"
