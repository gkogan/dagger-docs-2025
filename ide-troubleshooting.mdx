After running `dagger develop`, your IDE should automatically recognize Dagger Functions and provide autocomplete, type checking, and other language features. If these features aren't working, try the following solutions:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
<Tab value="go" title="Go">
Dagger creates a separate `go.mod` file for your module. To get IDE features like autocompletion and go-to-definition across your entire project, set up a Go workspace:

```shell
# in the root of your repository
go work init
go work use ./                    # your main project
go work use ./path/to/dagger/module  # your dagger module
```

Add workspace files to `.gitignore` (they're for local development only):

```shell
echo go.work >> .gitignore
echo go.work.sum >> .gitignore
```

Restart your IDE to enable full language support for your Dagger Functions.

</Tab>
<Tab value="python" title="Python">
For IDE features like autocompletion and type checking, install dependencies in a virtual environment:

```shell
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Using pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.lock -e ./sdk -e .
```

Open your IDE in the directory containing `.venv` and `pyproject.toml`. Most IDEs will automatically detect the virtual environment and provide full language support.

</Tab>
<Tab value="typescript" title="TypeScript">
The generated module includes a `tsconfig.json` file that maps the Dagger SDK to your local generated code:

```json
"paths": {
  "@dagger.io/dagger": ["./sdk"]
}
```

This configuration enables your IDE to provide autocompletion, type checking, and go-to-definition for Dagger Functions without any additional setup.

</Tab>
<Tab value="php" title="PHP">
The generated module includes a `composer.json` file that references the local Dagger SDK:

```json
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "path",
    "url": "./sdk"
  }
],
"require": {
  "dagger/dagger": "*@dev"
}
```

Open your IDE in the directory containing `composer.json`. Most PHP IDEs will automatically recognize the Dagger package and provide autocompletion and type hints.
</Tab>
<Tab value="java" title="Java">
The generated module creates a standard Maven project structure with a `pom.xml` file. Import this directory into your IDE as a Maven project.

Your IDE will automatically recognize the Dagger dependencies and provide code completion. Generated code is placed in `target/generated-sources` and automatically excluded from version control.
