Dagger SDKs make it easy to call the Dagger API from your favorite programming language, by developing Dagger Functions or custom applications.

A Dagger SDK provides two components:

- A client library to call the Dagger API from your code
- Tooling to extend the Dagger API with your own Dagger Functions (bundled in a Dagger module)

The Dagger API uses GraphQL as its low-level language-agnostic framework, and can also be accessed using any standard GraphQL client. However, you do not need to know GraphQL to call the Dagger API; the translation to underlying GraphQL API calls is handled internally by the Dagger SDKs.

Official Dagger SDKs are currently available for Go, TypeScript and Python. There are also [experimental and community SDKs contributed by the Dagger community](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/main/sdk).
