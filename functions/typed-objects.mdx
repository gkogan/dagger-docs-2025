title: "Typed Objects"
description: "Type-safe objects that form the building blocks of Dagger workflows"
---

Typed Objects are the core building blocks you work with in Dagger. They represent various resources and data structures that you can create, manipulate, and chain together to build powerful containerized workflows. These objects are type-safe, immutable, and provide a consistent interface across all supported programming languages.

## Key Characteristics

- **Type Safety**: Objects are strongly typed, preventing runtime errors and enabling IDE support
- **Immutability**: Operations return new objects rather than modifying existing ones
- **Chainability**: Objects can be chained together using fluent method calls
- **Cross-Language**: Same objects work consistently across Go, Python, TypeScript, and other SDKs

## Core Object Types

### Container

Represents a containerized environment for running commands and processes. This is the primary object for executing operations.

```python
# Create a container and run commands
result = (
    dagger.container()
    .from_("python:3.11")
    .with_exec(["pip", "install", "requests"])
    .with_exec(["python", "-c", "print('Hello from container')"])
    .stdout()
)
```

**Common operations:**
- `.from_()` - Set base image
- `.with_exec()` - Execute commands
- `.with_file()` - Add files to container
- `.with_directory()` - Mount directories
- `.with_env_variable()` - Set environment variables

### Directory

Represents a directory tree that can be mounted into containers or manipulated as a filesystem unit.

```python
# Work with directories
source_dir = dagger.host().directory("./src")
built_app = (
    dagger.container()
    .from_("node:18")
    .with_directory("/app", source_dir)
    .with_workdir("/app")
    .with_exec(["npm", "install"])
    .with_exec(["npm", "run", "build"])
    .directory("/app/dist")
)
```

**Common operations:**
- `.with_file()` - Add files to directory
- `.without_file()` - Remove files from directory
- `.entries()` - List directory contents
- `.export()` - Export directory to host

### File

Represents individual files that can be read, written, and shared between containers.

```python
# Work with files
config_file = dagger.host().file("./config.json")
processed_file = (
    dagger.container()
    .from_("alpine")
    .with_file("/input.json", config_file)
    .with_exec(["sed", "s/dev/prod/g", "/input.json"])
    .file("/input.json")
)
```

**Common operations:**
- `.contents()` - Read file contents
- `.export()` - Export file to host
- `.with_timestamps()` - Set file timestamps

### Service

Represents long-running services that can be accessed by other containers in your workflow.

```python
# Start a database service
database = (
    dagger.container()
    .from_("postgres:15")
    .with_env_variable("POSTGRES_PASSWORD", "secret")
    .with_exposed_port(5432)
    .as_service()
)

# Use the service in another container
app = (
    dagger.container()
    .from_("python:3.11")
    .with_service_binding("db", database)
    .with_exec(["python", "app.py"])
)
```

**Common operations:**
- `.as_service()` - Convert container to service
- `.with_service_binding()` - Bind service to container
- `.endpoint()` - Get service endpoint

### Secret

Represents sensitive data that can be securely passed to containers without exposing the values.

```python
# Use secrets securely
api_key = dagger.set_secret("api_key", "secret-value")
result = (
    dagger.container()
    .from_("alpine")
    .with_secret_variable("API_KEY", api_key)
    .with_exec(["curl", "-H", "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY", "https://api.example.com"])
)
```

**Common operations:**
- `.with_secret_variable()` - Set secret as environment variable
- `.with_mounted_secret()` - Mount secret as file

### Environment

Represents environment variables and configuration that can be shared across containers.

```python
# Set environment variables
env_vars = {"NODE_ENV": "production", "PORT": "3000"}
app = (
    dagger.container()
    .from_("node:18")
    .with_env_variable("NODE_ENV", "production")
    .with_env_variable("PORT", "3000")
    .with_exec(["npm", "start"])
)
```

### LLM

Represents integrations with large language models for AI-powered workflows.

```python
# Use LLM for code generation
llm = dagger.llm("openai")
generated_code = (
    llm.generate("Write a Python function that sorts a list")
)
```

## Working with Typed Objects

### Chaining Operations

Objects are designed to be chained together in fluent, readable workflows:

```python
# Complex workflow chaining multiple objects
result = (
    dagger.host()
    .directory("./src")                    # Directory object
    .with_file("config.json", config_file) # Add File object
    .pipe(lambda src:                      # Pass to container
        dagger.container()
        .from_("python:3.11")
        .with_directory("/app", src)       # Mount Directory
        .with_workdir("/app")
        .with_exec(["python", "main.py"])
        .stdout()
    )
)
```

### Type Safety Benefits

Strong typing provides immediate feedback and prevents common errors:

```python
# This will catch type errors at development time
container = dagger.container().from_("python:3.11")
directory = dagger.host().directory("./src")

# Type-safe: Directory can be mounted to Container
container.with_directory("/app", directory)

# Type error: Cannot mount Container to Container
# container.with_directory("/app", container)  # This would fail
```

## Best Practices

### Object Reuse

Objects are immutable, so you can safely reuse them:

```python
base_container = dagger.container().from_("python:3.11")

# Both containers start from the same base
app_container = base_container.with_directory("/app", source_dir)
test_container = base_container.with_directory("/tests", test_dir)
```

### Error Handling

Use appropriate error handling for object operations:

```python
try:
    result = (
        dagger.container()
        .from_("python:3.11")
        .with_exec(["python", "--version"])
        .stdout()
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to get Python version: {e}")
```
