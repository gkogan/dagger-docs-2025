Modules are packages for creating, sharing, and reusing Dagger Functions across different programming languages. When a module is loaded, the Dagger API is dynamically extended with new functions, allowing you to call both core functions and custom Dagger Functions from that module.

## Why Use Modules?

**Reusability**: Write complex automation logic once and use it across multiple projects
**Sharing**: Distribute automation tools across teams and the broader community  
**Composability**: Combine modules to create more powerful workflows
**Consistency**: Ensure the same automation logic runs identically across environments

## Module Structure

Each module has a consistent structure across programming languages:

- **Configuration file** (`dagger.json`) - Contains module metadata and dependencies
- **Source code directory** - Language-specific implementation files
- **Dependency management** - Language-native package files (e.g., `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`)
- **SDK directories** - Generated code and runtime resources

## Creating Modules

Creating a Dagger module allows you to package custom automation logic into reusable Dagger Functions that can be shared and used across different projects.

### Initialize a Dagger Module

<InitProject />

### Create a Dagger Function

Here's an example of a Dagger Function which calls a remote API method and returns the result:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
<TabItem value="go" title="Go">

Update the `main.go` file with the following code:

```go file=./snippets/functions/functions-complex/go/main.go
```

This Dagger Function includes the context as input and error as return in its signature.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" title="Python">

Update the `src/my_module/main.py` file with the following code:

```python file=./snippets/functions/functions-complex/python/main.py
```

Dagger Functions are implemented as [@dagger.function][@function] decorated methods, of a [@dagger.object_type][@object_type] decorated class.

It's possible for a module to implement multiple classes (*object types*), but **the first one needs to have a name that matches the module's name**, in *PascalCase*. This object is sometimes referred to as the *main object*.

[@function]: https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#dagger.function
[@object_type]: https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#dagger.object_type
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" title="TypeScript">

Update the `src/index.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript file=./snippets/functions/functions-complex/typescript/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" title="PHP">

Update the `src/MyModule.php` file with the following code:

```php file=./snippets/functions/functions-complex/php/src/MyModule.php
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" title="Java">

Update the `src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/mymodule/MyModule.java` file with the following code:

```java file=./snippets/functions/functions-complex/java/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/mymodule/MyModule.java
```

Dagger Functions must be public. The function must be decorated with the `@Function` annotation and the class containing the functions must be decorated with the `@Object` annotation.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Development Environment

Use `dagger develop --sdk=...` to set up local development resources. When implementing Dagger Functions, you can write arbitrary code that executes inside the module's container with access to the Dagger API and standard libraries.

## Using Modules

Modules can be used in two primary ways: using your own locally developed modules, and using modules shared by others from remote Git repositories.

### Using Your Own Modules

Once you've created a module, you can use it locally:

```shell
# Call a function from your local module
dagger call my-function --arg=value

# Call with multiple arguments
dagger call build-go --source=./src --version=1.21

# Interactive mode
dagger
my-function --arg=value
```

### Using Remote Modules

Remote modules allow you to use Dagger Functions from modules hosted in remote Git repositories.

#### Installing Remote Modules

```shell
# Install from Git repository
dagger install github.com/example/my-module

# Install specific version
dagger install github.com/example/my-module@v1.2.3
```

#### Direct Usage

Use modules directly from Git repositories with HTTPS or SSH authentication:

```shell
# HTTPS authentication
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.2.0 call \
  build --source=./src --args=./cmd/app

# SSH authentication
dagger -m git@github.com:kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.2.0 call \
  build --source=./src --args=./cmd/app
```

### Module Dependencies

- Modules can depend on other modules, creating a dependency chain
- Dependencies are automatically resolved and installed
- All dependencies are tracked in your `dagger.json` file
- Supports transitive dependencies and semantic versioning

## Sharing Modules

Once you've created useful modules, you can share them through public or private channels.

### Public Sharing via Daggerverse

Daggerverse is the public registry for Dagger modules, making it easy to discover and use community-contributed automation.

**Publishing to Daggerverse:**
1. Ensure your module is in a public Git repository
2. Tag your releases using semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
3. Submit to Daggerverse through the publishing process
4. Maintain documentation and examples for users

**Benefits:**
- Community discovery and collaboration
- Shared maintenance burden
- Recognition as an automation contributor

### Private Sharing with Teams

For organizations using Dagger Cloud, you can share modules privately within your team:

- **Host private modules** in internal repositories
- **Control access** with team-based permissions
- **Manage versions** and dependencies privately
- **Integrate with existing workflows** and CI/CD systems

### Git Repository Sharing

You can also share modules through any Git repository:

```shell
# Public repositories
dagger install github.com/user/repo

# Private repositories with SSH
dagger install git@github.com:user/private-repo
```

## Module Discovery

**Finding Modules:**
- Browse Daggerverse for public modules
- Search GitHub for Dagger modules
- Browse internal modules in your organization
- Community resources and documentation

**Evaluating Modules:**
- Check documentation quality and examples
- Review maintenance activity and community adoption
- Assess security practices and code quality
- Consider version stability and update frequency

## Best Practices

### For Module Publishers

- **Clear Documentation**: Provide comprehensive README and function documentation
- **Semantic Versioning**: Use proper versioning for releases
- **Testing**: Include tests and CI/CD pipelines
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples and common patterns

### For Module Users

- **Pin Versions**: Pin to specific versions for reproducible builds
- **Update Strategy**: Establish processes for updating module versions
- **Testing**: Test module updates in development environments
- **Rollback Plans**: Have rollback strategies for problematic updates

## Module Execution Environment

Dagger Functions execute within containers spawned by the Dagger Engine. This "sandboxing" serves important purposes:

1. **Reproducibility**: Executing in a well-defined container ensures Dagger Functions run the same way every time
2. **Caching**: A reproducible environment enables automatic caching of function results
3. **Security**: Functions don't have default access to your host environment - access must be explicitly granted
